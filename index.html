            tapping the grey balls and the game ends when any orange ball is

              In the summer of 2016, two friends of mine introduced me to
              <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Superswimmer9876/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>.
              For reference, Scratch is a website that allows users to build interactive
              programs, animations, and <em>games</em> with <em>a code made up of draggable blocks.</em>.
            </p>

            <p class="subsection">
              I <em>loved</em> Scratch. For the next six months, all I wanted to do
              in my free time was <em>build
                things</em> with Scratch.
              Through the time I spent with Scratch, I developed an strong understanding of fundamental programming
              concepts, and soon I began to reach <em>further</em>.

              <h5 class="text-muted mb-2 mt-4">Bouncing Balls</h5>
              Over the first few months of 2017, I built a small game called <em>Bouncing Balls</em> with <a
                href="https://appinventor.mit.edu">MIT App
                Inventor</a>, using a
              block-programming system similar to
              but slightly more advanced than Scratch.

              <h5 class="text-muted mb-2 mt-4">Web Dev</h5>
              In Spring of 2017, I taught myself basic web development (HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery), which really
              kicked
              off my journey into development.
              I built a few small sites with Bootstrap that spring, but by the next fall, I had grown an interest in
              <em>making games</em>.
            </p>

            <p class="subsection">
              <h5 class="text-muted mb-2 mt-4">Meteor Storm</h5>
              In December 2017, during my freshman year of high school, I began my first real software project. I
              build a
              mobile game with the Corona Game engine. I learned Lua and the Corona Game Engine's API with a Udemy
              Course,
              and after completing it, I was off to the races building my own game!
              Over the next three months, I built <a href="https://github.com/ZacharyEilers/Meteor-Storm"><em>Meteor
                  Storm</em></a>, a relatively simple game where the user taps and destroys asteroids flying towards
              the Earth in the center of the screen. If enough meteors hit the Earth, the Earth explodes and the game
              ends.

              Over the summer of 2018, I learned backend web development with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and the ejs
              templating engine, primarily from Colt Steele's <a
                href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Udemy Course</a> During the following
              fall semester, I slowly built <em>CodeJournal</em>, a blogging platform that I hoped would allow people
              like me to share what they were learning and read about what others were learning as well. Unfortunately,
              I didn't have a clear vision for the project, and it was never totally finished. I hope to come back one
              day, give it some shine, and turn it into the site I should've built it into all along.

              <h5 class="text-muted mb-2 mt-4">Mobile Dev with <em class="text-primary">Flutter</em></h5>
              In the Spring of 2019, I began learning Flutter because of its cross-platform nature. I wanted to
              build mobile apps, and Flutter seemed to be fastest way to do that.

            <p class="subsection">
              <h6 class="text-muted mb-2 mt-4"><em>Finished.</em></h6>
              After spending around 3 months learning the key parts of the Flutter Framework, I began working on a
              <em>Finished</em>. I wanted to build an app that allowed me to mark exactly<em>when</em> I was going to
              complete an assignment. That year when I was swimming for both a club team and my high school team, which
              left me with very little time to complete homework for my stacked courseload.
            </p>
            <p class="subsection">
              I wanted to give myself the peace of mind of knowing I was going to be able
              <em>finish</em> everything. <em>Finished.</em> was born from that desire. It features a built-in calendar
              that makes it easy to mark exactly when you planned to get something done before it was due. Since, its
              release, I've received thanks from countless parents and students who've used <em>Finished.</em> to help
              them manage their own busy schedules.

              <h6 class="text-muted mb-2 mt-4"><em>Swim Stats</em></h6>
              Over the summer of 2019, I also built <a href="#swim-stats"><em>Swim Stats</em></a>, a mobile app that
              allows users to look up the
              times of any of the 400,000 swimmers with USA Swimming. Since its release, the app has seen consistent
              accelerating growth as it spreads throughout the swimming community.

              <h5 class="text-muted mb-2 mt-4">Now and Beyond</h5>
              I hope to expand the reach <em>Finished.</em> and <em>Swim Stats</em> as I continue to work on them. I'm
              excited to see what 2020 brings.
